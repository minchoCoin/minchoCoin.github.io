# About me
Welcome to my blog!

I'm Taehun Kim and currently getting a master's degree in AI at Pusan National University

This is where I post summaries of my assignments and things I've studied on my own.

If you notice any mistakes in the content or grammar, feel free to leave a commentâ€”I'd really appreciate it!
